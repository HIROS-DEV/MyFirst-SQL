# MyFirst-SQL

## Overview

This is my first SQL project.

The web application as part of a code-along of Colt Steele's Udemy Course: The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert. 

This is very simple application. So, I decided to not create demo site. Because Heroku free service is limited resources.

But I am going to create MySQL project in the near future.

(I think this is great course. If you are absolute beginner SQL like me. But, if you have SQL knowledge already, I recommend you should take other courses.)
